Three-day weather forecast app made with React

This web-app is made for mobile use. It will run on a desktop, but the UI is designed for mobile use.

The app takes weather data from https://openweathermap.org/api. API call is implemented with Axios.

This was my first time building something with React from start to finish all by myself. the design is also my own.

This project helped me to understand the fundamentals of React. The hardest part was to figure out how to get all the weather data with API-call.
